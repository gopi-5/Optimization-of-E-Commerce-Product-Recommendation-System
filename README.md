## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated recommendation engine for e-commerce platforms, leveraging machine learning to suggest products based on user behavior, content features, and popularity trends.

---

## Features
- **Multi-model approach**: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid methods, and popularity-based suggestions.
- Techniques include matrix factorization (e.g., Truncated SVD), TF-IDF vectorization, similarity measures, and hybrid strategies.
- Emphasis on **scalability and efficiency**, designed for real-world e-commerce use.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
```

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn

````

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gopi-5/Optimization-of-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System.git
cd Optimization-of-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

Launch the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook miniprojcode.ipynb
```

Step through for:

* Data exploration

## Models & Techniques

* **Collaborative Filtering**: User‚Äìitem interaction matrix, cosine similarity, SVD(), and NMF().
* **Matrix Factorization**: Latent factor modeling using SVD-based approaches.
* **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF + cosine similarity on product attributes.
* **Popularity-Based Filtering**: Ranking items by mean ratings and number of ratings.
* **Hybrid Methods**: Weighted combination of content and collaborative filtering.
* **Hybrid + Popularity Filtering**: Merges hybrid results with popularity metrics for best performance.
---

## Evaluation

* Metrics: RMSE(), MAE() (for rating prediction), Precision, Recall, F1.
* Test strategies: train/test split, cross-validation.
* Visualizations: rating distributions, popularity distributions, recommendation comparisons.

---

## Results

The system was tested across multiple approaches, with the following insights:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**

   * Personalized recommendations based on product features.
   * High precision when evaluating well-described products.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**

   * Captured strong user‚Äìuser and item‚Äìitem similarity patterns.
   * Effective when sufficient interaction data is available.

3. **Popularity-Based Filtering**

   * Recommended trending products with high ratings and review counts.
   * Less personalized but solved the cold-start problem.

4. **Hybrid Filtering (Content + Collaborative)**

   * Balanced personalization and community insights.
   * Higher F1-scores compared to individual models.

5. **Hybrid + Popularity Filtering**

   * Consistently outperformed all methods.
   * Best recall and overall balance of personalization + trending relevance.

### Visual Outputs (from the report):

* ‚úÖ Missing values handled and distributions plotted.
* ‚úÖ Content-based recommendations (Fig 3).
* ‚úÖ Collaborative filtering recommendations (Fig 4).
* ‚úÖ Popularity metrics and recommendations (Figs 5 & 6).
* ‚úÖ Hybrid recommendations (Fig 6).
* ‚úÖ Hybrid + Popularity recommendations (Fig 7).

**Key Finding:**
The **Hybrid + Popularity model** was the best overall, combining personalization, diversity, and popularity to maximize relevance and scalability.

## Optimization & Performance

* Dimensionality reduction (Truncated SVD) for efficiency and reduced overfitting.
* Hyperparameter tuning: latent dimensions, similarity thresholds.
* Future improvements: debiasing, deep learning methods, real-time recommendation pipelines.
