## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated recommendation engine for e-commerce platforms, leveraging machine learning to suggest products based on user behavior, content features, and popularity trends.

---

## Features
- **Multi-model approach**: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid methods, and popularity-based suggestions.
- Techniques include matrix factorization (e.g., Truncated SVD), TF-IDF vectorization, similarity measures, and hybrid strategies.
- Emphasis on **scalability and efficiency**, designed for real-world e-commerce use.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
```

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn

````

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gopi-5/Optimization-of-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System.git
cd Optimization-of-E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

Launch the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook miniprojcode.ipynb

## Models & Techniques

* **Collaborative Filtering**: User–user and item–item similarity (cosine, Pearson).
* **Matrix Factorization**: Latent factor modeling using SVD-based approaches.
* **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF scoring and similarity measures.
* **Hybrid Methods**: Combination of collaborative and content-based models.

---

## Evaluation

* Metrics: RMSE, MAE (for rating prediction), Precision\@K, Recall\@K.
* Test strategies: train/test split, cross-validation.
* Visualizations: precision-recall curves, evaluation plots.

---

## Optimization & Performance

* Dimensionality reduction (Truncated SVD) for efficiency and reduced overfitting.
* Hyperparameter tuning: latent dimensions, similarity thresholds.
* Future improvements: debiasing, deep learning methods, real-time recommendation pipelines.
